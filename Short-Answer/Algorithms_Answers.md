Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.
a) In the example a, we have a while loop. If you count how many times loop run , it runs the n number of times. The loop will run as long as a is less then n to the power of 3. So the loop will run untill it meet (n^3). Inside of a loop a will be incremented by n^2. So n^3 / n ^2 = (n), and we can say that the cycle will run n times. The time complexity is O(n). And space complexity should be O(1), since we only allocating memory to a varable a.

b) In the example b, we have 4 for loops, all nested within one athother. From the first look we could say we could have O(n^4) with those nested loops, but this answer will be incorrect. Here is why, if we look close at the last loop: for l in range(k + 1, 10 + k). This loop will run always constant time no matter what k is, and this loop will be O(1). So time complexity in the example b, will be O(n^3). The space complexity should be O(1), as we allocating memory to a handfull of integer variables.
